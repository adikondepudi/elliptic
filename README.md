Elliptic Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis

The goal of this project was to leverage network data science libraries and techniques to analyze the network of entities and transactions within the Elliptic Dataset, a an open dataset mapping transactions between entities, both licit and illicit.

Due to computing and time restraints, a large portion of the project is focused on a specific cluster of entities and transactions, specifically the cluster falling under time step 27. However, general analysis and classification was deployed on all licit, illicit, and unknown transactions. 

The 'kondepudi.ipynb" file contains a organized notebook of all techniques and methods applied to the dataset.
