Elliptic Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis

This project was created by Aditya Kondepudi for Network Data Science, an introductory network data science course at Johns Hopkins University.

The goal of this project was to leverage the skills we learned in class to investigate a network. This project uses data science libraries within python to visualize and analyze cryptocurrency transactions among entities. The data is taken from the Elliptic Data Set, an open dataset mapping transactions among both licit and illicit entities. 

Due to computing and time restraints, a large portin of the project is focused on the 2% of initially classified illicit transactions. However, general analysis and classification was deployed on all licit, illicit, and unknown transactions.
